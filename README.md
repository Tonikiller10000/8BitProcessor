### Description:
This is a series of 3 (*not finished) modules witch make an functional 8 bit processor for educational purposes. After testing each module board separatly, I will make a big board with all of them.

Modules:  
- [ALU](https://github.com/Tonikiller10000/8BitProcessor/tree/main/Processor_ALU_V1.0)
- [Display Register](https://github.com/Tonikiller10000/8BitProcessor/tree/main/DisplayRegister)
